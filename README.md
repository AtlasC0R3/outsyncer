# Outsyncer
A CLI-based app meant to synchronize songs from one device to another, *but can also be used to sort song files elegantly*

**THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED YET!** If you use it *now*, be ready to figure out how this thing works by yourself.
Please look at the [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/AtlasC0R3/projects/2) page for this project.

spoiler alert: if you don't like swear words, don't go through the code.
<!-- fucking told you. -->

## What can it do?
- **synchronize music files from one device to another** through KDE Connect (Linux only)
- convert files before synchronizing *using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)*
- customize how files are organized *(custom formats, not quite "reliable")*
- **reorganize music files and directories** to a specific directory using custom formats
- exclude specific tracks, albums or artists from being sorted/synchronized
